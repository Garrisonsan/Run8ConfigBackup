# Run8ConfigBackup
Creates a backup of core config files in Run-8 Train Simulator V3

This script will copy Run-8 V3 spawn points, industry configs, hump configs, routings, and AI traffic configs into a folder called Run8Run8ConfigBackup_[DATE-TIME]
for easy backup or transfer.  Place it in your Run8Studios directory and run it from there.

The resulting directory tree can then be dragged and dropped into a Run8 Train Simulator V3 directory to update configs from the backup.

BarstowYermo, Bakersfield, Cajon, Mojave, Needles, SanBernardino, Seligman, ALine, Mohawk, Selkirk, Waycross, Fitzgerald, and Roseville route configs will be backed up.
HRS_Southeast, NorthernCA, SelkirkRegion, and SouthernCA region configs will be backed up.
